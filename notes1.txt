to implement:
    lucky draw variables? with this we can also implement the lucky draw page with statistics
    leaderboard live update using javascript
    static view of pages for users who dont login
    table system implementation:
        a dealer can "checkin" to a table and claim the spot as well as have the ability to checkout
        players can checkin to a table as well and only leave once their chips are gone
        dealer view has convert button which converts players hp and bounty to another winning player
        table system changes convert button after the first round
        superadmin can access and kick dealers out or even users as well as change their values


to consider:
    bounty system implementation (similar to tipping), do we want the player stats to 
    change everytime someone tips or places a bounty?
